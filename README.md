# eatogather-web

My first full node app. Done as the MVP of my Mobile system programming course..

This was coded dirtily on the weekends with fast approaching deadline and very demanding mobile application developers. 

Hosted on heroku @ eatogather.herokuapp.com/ as of 22nd April 2017.

Queries.js has all the api endpoints implemented.
